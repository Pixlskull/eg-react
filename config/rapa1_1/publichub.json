desc:'The two collection of genome-wide sequencing results are from Heading Chinese cabbage (B. rapa ssp. pekinensis. cv Bre) and non-heading Chinese cabbage (B. rapa ssp. chinensis. cv Wut) respectively. Four RNA sequencing data are from the seedling (3 weeks-old) and inflorescence apices (IA) (2 month-old) of Bre and Wut, respectively.  Data are available as sequencing reads aligned to the reference genome.',
