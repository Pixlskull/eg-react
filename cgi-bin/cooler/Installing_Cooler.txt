To allow the server to serve Cooler files, do the following:

1.  Install cooler of not already done.  To install, run `pip install cooler` on the command line (requires Python and pip).
2.  Create a directory where the .cool files will live.
3.  Modify `coolDirectory.py` so it points to the directory created in the previous step.  Be sure it ends with a slash ('/')!

Yours truly,

Silas Hsu
