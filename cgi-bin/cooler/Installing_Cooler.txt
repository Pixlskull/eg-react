To allow the server to serve Cooler files, do the following:

1.  Install cooler if not already done.  To install, run `pip install cooler` on the command line (requires Python and pip).
2.  Create a directory where the .cool files will live.
3.  Modify `coolUtils.py` so COOL_DIR points to the directory created in the previous step.  Be sure it ends with a slash ('/')!
For example, if you wanted to serve from `/myCoolDir`, type `COOL_DIR = "/myCoolDir/"`
4.  Finally, make sure version of numpy is at least 1.13.  You can check with `pip show numpy`.  Update with
`pip install numpy --upgrade`.

Yours truly,
